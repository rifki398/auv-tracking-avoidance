# AUV Path Tracking and Obstacle Avoidance
AUV Simulation for Path Tracking and Obstacle Avoidance
This repository contains a simulation framework for an **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)** performing path tracking and obstacle avoidance. The implementation uses MATLAB for the main simulation and Python for data visualization.

## Project Structure
- ```data/```: Output data generated by the simulation.
- ```estimator/```: Slip angle observer functions.
- ```gnc/```: Guidance, navigation, and control scripts.
- ```lib/```: Supporting utility functions.
- ```model/```: AUV dynamics and simulation models.
- ```main.m```: Main entry point for running the simulation (MATLAB).
- ```plot_data.py```: Visualization script (Python).

## How to Use
### 1. Run the Simulation (MATLAB)
Run the following script from MATLAB to execute the simulation: ```main.m```.    
Simulation results will be saved automatically to the ```data/``` folder in .mat file.

### 2. Visualize the Results (Python)
To visualize the simulation output, run the Python script: ```plot_data.py```

## Dependencies
1. MATLAB
2. Python 3.X with NumPy, matplotlib
