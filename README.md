# AUV Path Tracking and Obstacle Avoidance
AUV Simulation for Path Tracking and Obstacle Avoidance
This repository contains a simulation framework for an **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)** performing path tracking and obstacle avoidance. The implementation uses MATLAB for the main simulation and Python for data visualization.

## 🚀 How to Use
### 1. Run the Simulation (MATLAB)
Run the following script from MATLAB to execute the simulation:
```matlab main```
Simulation results will be saved automatically to the data/ folder in .mat or .csv format depending on your implementation.
### 2. Visualize the Results (Python)
To visualize the simulation output, run the Python script:
```python plot_data.py```

## Dependencies
1. MATLAB
2. Python 3.X with NumPy, matplotlib
